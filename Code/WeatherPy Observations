Observations:

1. Temperature increases as we approach the equator. It does appear to have a max just before the equator, or not a huge discenerable temperature change at this point. 

2. The data show that there is no relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, considering the high humidity of most cities, it is suprising to see that there are not more cities with high cloudiness. Especially when lattitudes further from the equator tend to have lower temperatures, and therefore, a lower threshold for humidity. 

3. There doesn't seem to be a correlation between wind speed and lattitude according to this data. I would be interested to further explore the typical weather patterns around the world for the recorded date to see if they typically pick up or slow down.
